** Introduction

STW-UTILS is a basic utility library, used by the CL-COMP and STW-DB and STW-XML-PARSE libraries. It contains string functions, a lexer, list functions, and a stateful character trie, a radix trie and a byte-trie.

This library is a work in progress. Many functions/features can be found in more stable libraries such as alexandria. It is recommended that they be your first port of call.
